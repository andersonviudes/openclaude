/**
 * Nested-memory content delta — announce only the memory files whose
 * content changed (or are new / removed) between turns.
 *
 * WHY: `getNestedMemoryAttachments` (src/utils/attachments.ts) today
 * emits a fresh `nested_memory` attachment per trigger per turn, each
 * rendered into a `<system-reminder>` user message. The file contents
 * are usually stable for long stretches of a session — re-emitting
 * them every turn burns tokens on payload-billed providers (Copilot)
 * and misses implicit prefix caching (OpenAI / Kimi / DeepSeek / Codex)
 * because the rest of the prefix drifts around them.
 *
 * Mirrors the pattern of:
 *   - `src/utils/mcpInstructionsDelta.ts`
 *   - `src/utils/toolSearch.ts` (`getDeferredToolsDelta`)
 *   - `src/utils/attachments.ts` (`getAgentListingDeltaAttachment`)
 *
 * Scan prior `memory_delta` attachments → reconstruct {path → hash} →
 * compare with current {path → content} → emit {addedNames,
 * addedContent, removedNames}.
 *
 * Hash is content-based (djb2Hash — project-standard drift hash; same
 * helper used by promptCacheBreakDetection.ts) — cheap and collision-
 * free enough at session scale. A path that disappears from the current
 * set is a retraction (file no longer in the resolved nested-memory
 * rules).
